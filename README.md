# DefetcsDetection

This repository contains the data for the paper « Stratified definition of defects in crystalline solids using machine learning outlier detection” A. M. Goryaeva et al. 

There are two folders:
BCC_Fe/bispectrum_bSO4_j3.5_Rc4  - The descriptors and structural data for defects in BCC
FCC_Al/Bispectrum_bSO4_j3.5_Rc5  - The descriptors and structural data for defects in FCC

Each directory have three folders:
Training_Database  - the defects-free structural data and descriptors used to train the model detection 
Test_Database - the defects structural data and descriptors used for the defect analysis detection 
MCD_results_xyz – Results of the defects detection Cartesian coordinates and the MCD distances. 

The README of each folder contains the names of the files associated to each type of defect.
