Files:
  *.poscar  -> poscar files used to compute desriptors. These  files were generated from the xyz files provided by the database 
               used  in the developement of the GAP potential located at http://www.libatoms.org/Home/IronGAP. Here, we have used the 
               data labeled as "primitive" and "bulk" on the http://www.libatoms.org/Home/IronGAP .
  *.eml     -> descriptor files
  *.xyz     -> Cartesian coordinates with computed distortion scores
  
File names: 
  01_10*_****** -> defect-free structures for training
  06_101_000001 -> <110> SIA dumbbell
  07_101_000001 -> monovacancy
  07_103_000001 -> divacancy
  08_110_000001 -> C15 cluster
  09_102_000001 -> non-parallel (NP) cluster
  13_110_0000** -> NEB path: C15-NP transition
  14_100_0000** -> NEB path: 1/2<111> dislocation dipole
